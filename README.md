# Netlib
Netlib is a high performance Swift based machine learning framework that runs on Linux and MacOS. Netlib fully leverages cuDNN and Cuda, but is not architectually dependent on them. Netlib does not require the use of Python and was designed to minimize external dependencies for portability.

Initial performance tests indicate Netlib is approximately 4X faster than Caffe2 and TensorFlow.

Netlib is a research project written entirely in Swift 4.0, with a small amount of C and Cuda code. Netlib intentionally has no Objective-C dependencies.
